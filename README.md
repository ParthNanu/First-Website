# First-Website
Hi I am a freshman student, learning different skills and technologies. I am new to Git-Hub too.
My sister has a bakery house and she wanted a website for displaying her products online by which I came with an idea of developing a website for her, being a freshman I don't have proper grip over HTML/CSS/JavaScript so I took help from youtube and made this for her its just a prototype. 
THANKS FOR READING !!!!
